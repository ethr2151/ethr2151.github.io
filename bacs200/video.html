                    Video Script: 

Before I begin this Video I would like to explain what the better business bureau is: 

The website says Quote: 
“For more than 100 years, the Better Business Bureau has been helping people find businesses, brands and charities they can trust. In 2019, people turned to BBB more than 183 million times for BBB Business Profiles on nearly 5.8 million businesses and Charity Reports on 11,000 charities, all available for free at BBB.org.” 
•	Since 1912, BBB has helped people make smarter buying decisions, and BBB is evolving to meet today’s fast changing marketplace needs.
•	BBB sets standards for ethical business behavior and monitors compliance. Almost 400,000 Accredited Businesses meet and commit to our high standards.
•	BBB helps consumers identify trustworthy businesses, and those that aren’t, through more than 5.4 million BBB Business Profiles.
•	BBB sets standards for and evaluates the practices of thousands of charities so that donors know where their money is going.
•	BBB coaches businesses on ethical behavior and how to build stronger, more trusting relationships with their customers.
•	BBB offers its national and local consumer services online and in person, helping people nearly a quarter of a billion times each year.
•	BBB is a trusted source for the news media, and its messaging reaches hundreds of millions more through stories in both traditional and social media.
So. Now we know what the better business bureau is. 
Lets look at a recent case. 
One of the cool parts of the BBB’s Website is that you can see recent scams in your area. 
As for myself, I live in Greeley, Colorado
 
Lets look at a case together: 
This scam is in Glendale Colorado
Scam Type
Travel/Vacation/Timeshare Scam
Scam ID
449092
Business Name Used
American Financial Management Group
Date Reported
Nov 02, 2020

80246
Total Dollars Lost
$10,000.00
Scam Description
William Fernandez, who works for Americanfinancialgroup.us. is the salesperson who asks the customer to wire money to Mexico to charge different upfront fees and taxes. This person on working with holding company Eleanor Bennet of midwestinvestmentholdings.com. They ask to wire money to Mexico to the bank account of New Property Development to pay SAT and other fees. We tried to call Eleanor Bennett but it seems like this person doesn't exist. They said the Mexican government is changed its tax laws. Upon closing, they said the Mexican government changed its law again and must pay upfront fees for additional taxes. I realize this was a scam after calling an attorney and sending documentation to them.
