        Why do we look up to people? What classifies someone as influential?
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that someone who we can classify as heroic is someone who stands out among the majority. Someone who stands for their beliefs among the people who believe otherwise.
        I chose Tim Tebow not only because he played for the Denver Broncos, or that he is a famous athelete, but because he stands up for his beliefs.
        Among all of the other people who believed otherwise or did not want to take the flame that would come from speaking up about their Faith, Tim Tebow stands up for the Gospel every time he gets the chance.
        It is very known to everyone that he has a relationship with Christ and it shows with his character and demeanor.
        He was always someone I could look up to and use as an example for everything I do, and I hope he has the same impact on others.
        The main characteristics I believe a hero should have is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Courage. Willingness to throw their reputation out of the window to stand ip for their beliefs.</li>
        <li>Positive. Will show joy even in their hard times, be an example of positivity.</li>
        <li>Good Character. Will show what it means to be a real leader.</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        <li>Honesty. They are fair and just and truthful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I have never witnessed someone on such a big stage boldly stand up for Christ and their calling as a man, a leader, an athelete, and now a husband.
        I truly look up to Tim Tebow and i hope i can be as courageous as him someday.
